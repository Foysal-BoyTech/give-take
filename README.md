# give-take

The app is a platform where people can display pictures of their unused/extra items they no longer need, and the people who need any of that displayed items can pick from. The app shows the location of the displayed products, so anyone can locate and pick from the exact address. The interested party (taker) would also be able to send private text to the giver.
