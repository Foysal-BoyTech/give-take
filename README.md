# give-take

The app will be a platform where people can display pictures of their unused/extra items they no longer need, and the people who need any of that displayed items can pick from. The app will show the location of the displayed products, so anyone can locate and pick from the exact address. The interested party (taker) would also be able to send text to the giver.
